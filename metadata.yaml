  The CharmScaler is an autoscaler for Juju applications. Based on Elastisys'
  autoscaling engine, it rightsizes your application deployments using
  sophisticated auto-scaling algorithms to ensure that the application runs
  cost-efficiently and is responsive at all times, even in the face of sudden
  load spikes. At times of high anticipated load your charm is reinforced with
  additional units -- units that are automatically decomissioned as the
  pressure on your application goes down.
